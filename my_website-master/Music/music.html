						Spotify is an audio streaming platform launched by Spotify AB on 7 October 2008. It provides
						DRM-protected music and
						podcasts from record labels and media companies . Spotify provides access to more than 40
						million tracks.Spotify was
						developed in 2006 by a team at Spotify AB , in Stockholm , Sweden. The company was founded by
						Daniel Ek, former CTO of
						Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of TradeDoubler. The company's title, according to
						Daniel Ek, was initially
						misheard from a name shouted by Martin Lorentzon. Later they thought out an etymology of a
						combination of "spot" and "identify".
